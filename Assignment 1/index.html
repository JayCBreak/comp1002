    <p>This one's dedicated to all the hackers</p> 

    <p><i>[Verse 1: int eighty]</i></p>
    <p>Even out settle scores quick</p>
    <p>Our disaster recovery requires even more disks</p>
    <p>Put your bytes up, prove it or you forfeit</p>
    <p>Got my C64 and we blew it into orbit</p> <!-- Did you own a C64? -->

    <p>M. Bison with eight straight perfects</p>
    <p>Overvolt emotions make hate break circuits</p>
    <p>In case you heard, it's a named fake service</p>
    <p>Optimize our runtime to escape verdicts</p>
    <p>Got an integer scope flow</p>
    <p>That they can't sign</p>
    <p>Passing code, didn't sanitize</p>
    <p>Command lines; land mine</p>

    <p>So before, they'll see me after</p>
    <p>I'm Advice dog</p>
    <p>Courage Wolf</p>
    <p>Plus Philosoraptor</p>

    <p>Don't prove we're human unless we really hafta</p>
    <p>My team built schemes that destroyed recaptcha</p>
    <p>Hate what they see, finish this chapter</p>
    <p>By the way we're not any geeks, we hack into NASA</p>

    <p><i>[Chorus]</i></p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>

    <p>Got this Vodka and this Redbull</p>
    <p>They still give me wings</p>
    <p>You might also like</p>

    <p>LET GO</p>
    <p>Central Cee</p>
    <p>Maybae Baeby</p>
    <!-- No clue what this is saying -->
    <p>Xiu Xiu</p>
    <p>So we drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>

    <p>Zero through three</p>
    <p>We're in every single ring</p>

    <p><i>[Verse 2: int eighty]</i></p>
    <p>I'm just waiting 'til my Blackberry dies</p>
    <p>Cause I'll replace it with a Raspberry Pi</p>

    <p>Don't compare to this track</p>
    <p>It makes everything they said dull</p>
    <p>Neutralize any threat</p>
    <p>Turn Red Skull to /dev/null</p>

    <p>They killed virus writers that we mentioned</p>
    <p>But instead they ascended to the VXHeavens</p>
    <p>Then reincarnate as live wires</p>
    <p>Still inside we hide ciphers in signed device drivers</p>

    <p>Which school will we hit next?</p>
    <p>They didn't learn the format</p>
    <p>So we've gotta printf()</p>
    <p>Next step is a chin check</p>
    <p>Freestyles that I spit best</p>
    <p>They didn't decrypt yet</p>
    <p>I crush internet MCs in rhyme battles</p>
    <p>Get your WiFi tackled</p>
    <p>Hak5 Pineapple</p>
    <p>I don't think you'll like my Snapple</p>
    <p>Cause I popped it with vodka</p>
    <p>And a cyanide capsule</p>

    <p><i>[Chorus]</i></p>
    <p>We drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>

    <p>Got this Vodka and this Redbull</p>
    <p>They still give me wings</p>

    <p>So we drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>

    <p>(You know there's going to be security, right?)</p>

    <p><i>[Verse 3: int eighty]</i></p>
    <p>First we drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Then hack all the things</p>
    <p>Then backdoor the firmware</p>
    <p>On anything you bring</p>

    <p>Regardless of the hardware, service, or encoding</p>
    <p>Connect it to the internet</p>
    <p>And someone's gonna own it</p>

    <p>This is for the pirates who clap</p>
    <p>And love the sound</p>
    <p>Attacking from the cloud</p>
    <p>Then we're back and underground</p>

    <p>There's no masking from us now</p>
    <p>We pop Tor nodes around the globe</p>
    <p>Track and hunt you down</p>
    <p>Hacked on schedule, added to your calendar</p>
    <p>Devices online; here comes another challenger</p>

    <p>State infiltrated, so undercover</p>
    <p>This is for my comrades who stare at their debuggers</p>
    <p>And trace every buffer</p>
    <p>Examining the code flow</p>
    <p>Haven't been to sleep? Better pop another No-Doz</p>
    <p>I think I'll need a planet sized urn</p>

    <p>'Cause some men just wanna see the world burn</p>
    <p>Your turn</p>

    <p><i>[Chorus]</i></p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>

    <p>Got this Vodka and this Redbull</p>
    <p>They still give me wings</p>

    <p>So we drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>
    <p>Drink all the booze</p>
    <p>Hack all the things</p>

    <p>Zero through three</p>
    <p>We're in every single ring</p> <!-- I believe this refers to the OS rings where ring 0 is full access -->
